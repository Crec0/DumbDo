# DumbDo

A stupidly simple todo list application that just works. No complex database, no unnecessary features - just todos.

## Features

- âœ¨ Clean, minimal interface
- ðŸŒ“ Dark/Light mode with system preference detection
- ðŸ’¾ File-based storage - todos persist between sessions
- ðŸ“± Fully responsive design
- ðŸš€ Fast and lightweight
- ðŸ”’ PIN protection (4-10 digits if enabled)

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Default | Required |
|----------|-------------|---------|----------|
| PORT | The port number the server will listen on | 3000 | No |
| DUMBDO_PIN | PIN protection for accessing todos (4-10 digits) | - | No |

## Quick Start

### Running Locally

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dumbdo.git
cd dumbdo
```

2. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the server
```bash
npm start
```

4. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser

### Using Docker

1. Build the image
```bash
docker build -t dumbdo .
```

2. Run the container
```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 -v $(pwd)/data:/app/data dumbdo
```

## Storage

Todos are stored in a JSON file at `./data/todos.json`. The file is automatically created when you first run the application. 

To backup your todos, simply copy the `data` directory. To restore, place your backup `todos.json` in the `data` directory.

## Development

The application follows the "Dumb" design system principles:

- No complex storage
- Single purpose, done well
- "It just works"

## Contributing

This is meant to be a simple application. If you're writing complex code to solve a simple problem, you're probably doing it wrong. Keep it dumb, keep it simple.
